# NIST800HomeGame
Fundamentals of NIST based cyber security

This is a fun exercise to learn how exposed you are in your own home.

Start with "Home Game" - this is the foundation of gathering information about what you have, what is connected, and what accounts it all uses.
Quite easy for most homes, but a real effort for most businesses.

The next part is the PSPC - Policies, Standards, Procedures and Controls - how beauracracy is built up around controlling the equipment and applications we defined in part 1.

You can take the "Audit" to see how well you have implemented cyber security at home.

Only hard core nerds need to read the SOC (Separation of Concern) doc.

Enjoy!
